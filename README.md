# ProductCatalogSwift

## Overview
ProductCatalogSwift is a **Swift console application** converted from the original C# version. It allows users to manage a product catalog by entering product details, viewing sorted product lists, and searching for products—all through a simple terminal interface.

## Features
- Add products with the following details:
  - **Category** (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.)
  - **Product Name** (custom user input)
  - **Price** (must be a positive decimal value)
- **Sorted output**: Displays products sorted by price in ascending order.
- **Search functionality**: Find products by name.
- **Error handling**: Ensures valid input and prevents invalid entries.
- **Clean terminal UX**: Screen clears and colors help guide user input.

## How to Use
1. Run the application using `swift run`.
2. Enter a category, product name, and price.
3. View the sorted product list with total price calculation.
4. Search for a specific product by name.
5. Use commands:
   - Enter `P` to add another product.
   - Enter `S` to search for a product.
   - Enter `Q` to quit the application.
